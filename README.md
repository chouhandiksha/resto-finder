## Abstract

Customer Service is a core service for a lot of businesses around the world and it is getting
disrupted at the moment by Natural Language Processing-powered applications.

In this first assignment we are implementing a serverless, microservice-driven web
application. Specifically, this is a Dining Concierge chatbot that sends you
restaurant suggestions given a set of preferences that you provide the chatbot with
through conversation.
